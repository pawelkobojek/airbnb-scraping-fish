# Airbnb scraping by Scraping Fish üêü

This repository accompanies a [blog post](https://scrapingfish.com/blog/scraping-airbnb) and contains a comprehensive tutorial for scraping public Airbnb offers using [Scraping Fish](https://scrapingfish.com) API. It is provided in the airbnb-data-exploration python notebook and shows how to scrape offers and visualize the dataset.

To be able to run it and actually scrape the data, you will need Scraping Fish API key which you can buy here: [Scraping Fish request packs](https://scrapingfish.com/buy). You will get the smallest pack of 1,000 API requests for $2 to run this tutorial and play with the API on your own ‚õπÔ∏è. **Without Scraping Fish API key you won't be able to scrape Airbnb as it requires javascript rendering ‚õîÔ∏è**.

[Scraping Fish](https://scrapingfish.com) is a premium API for scraping powered by rotating 4G/LTE proxy by default. It is the best available proxy type for scraping since mobile IPs are ephemeral and constantly reassigned between real users. This type of proxy is capable of scraping even the most demanding websites, without being blocked. You can read more on advanced topics in Scraping Fish API [Documentation](https://scrapingfish.com/docs/intro).
